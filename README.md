# gl-plot2d

#### Abstract

A WebGL based 2D plotting framework for interactive big data visualizations. (>1 million in browser)

#### Description

This is a low level API which is responsible for various WebGL based plotting functions.  It only handles rasterization, and does not handle user interactions or window functions.  The intention is that this library may then be embedded into larger applications or wrapped in some layer which provides the necessary visualization UI.
